I am a MSc. Student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) working with [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) in the [Representations Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home).
My research interests lie at the crossfields between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in psychology, computational social science, and emotions in language. I am also interested in semantics, and low-resource NLP.

I completed my BSc. Honors in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) and [Dr. Carrie Demmans Epp](http://www.cdemmansepp.com/) in the [EdTeKLA Research Group](https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/edtekla/) where I explored research projects in various areas of NLP such as machine translation, training classifiers on a dataset of tweets, building language models which were applied to better understand reading processed, and creating a corpus of language resources.
