I am a MSc. Student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta working with [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) in the [Representations Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home).
My research interests lie at the crossfields between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and applications in psychology, public health and sentiment analysis. I am also interested in semantics, and low-resource NLP.
