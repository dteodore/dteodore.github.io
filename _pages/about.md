I am a MSc. Student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta working with Dr. Alona Fyshe in the Representations Lab.
My research interests lie at the crossfields between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and applications in psychology, public health and sentiment analysis. I am also interested in semantics, and low-resource NLP.
