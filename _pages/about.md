Hello! I am a PhD Student in Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) working with [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) in the [Representations Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home).
My research interests are Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more specifically computational social science, emotions in language, semantics, and low-resource NLP. I am also interested in the crossfields between NLP and psychology, which inspired my exploration into these areas. 

I completed my BSc. Honors with Distinction in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, where I worked with [Dr. Alona Fyshe](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~alona/) in the [Representations Lab](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/representationslab/home), and [Dr. Carrie Demmans Epp](http://www.cdemmansepp.com/) in the [EdTeKLA Research Group](https://spaces.facsci.ualberta.ca/edtekla/). I worked on research projects in various areas of NLP such as machine translation, training classifiers on a dataset of tweets, created a corpus of language resources, and built language models to help understand the reading processes of native and non-native English speakers.

In my spare time I like to spend time outdoors, go hiking, and bake desserts!
